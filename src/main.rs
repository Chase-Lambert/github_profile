        about: "I am a self taught developer who has experience building full stack web apps.   \
                I have used Javascript with React (and Python with Flask and Django) but mostly \
                prefer using Clojure(script) and now Rust. \
                I am currently looking for full or part time work with Rust. \
                I prefer remote but will consider relocation within the US.  \
                I have mainly focused on web development but am open to other projects as well.",
